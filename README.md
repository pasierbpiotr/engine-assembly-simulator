# **VR Engine Assembly Training Application**
For the Polish version, see [README_PL.md](README_PL.md).
## **Overview**
This Unity-based virtual reality (VR) application provides an interactive learning environment for assembling a car engine, created for the purpose of an engineering thesis. Designed primarily for automotive students, trainee mechanics, and enthusiasts, it simulates the step-by-step assembly process using realistic 3D models and an intuitive VR interface. The project aims to enhance hands-on training while reducing the costs and limitations associated with physical engine prototypes.

## **Features**
- **Interactive Engine Assembly** – Users can assemble a Mitsubishi 6G7 engine using detailed 3D models.
- **Sequential Assembly System** – Parts are unlocked in a guided sequence, ensuring a structured learning experience.
- **Real-Time Validation** – Intelligent sockets verify the correct placement of components.
- **Dynamic Instructions** – On-screen guidance updates in real time to assist users through each step.
- **Time Tracking** – The system records assembly times for individual parts and entire sections.
